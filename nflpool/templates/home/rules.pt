        <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>Before the NFL season starts, you will make the following picks for the season:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Division winners, 2nd place and last place for all four divisions in both the NFC and AFC.
                (24 picks)</li>
                <li>Wild Card winners (2) from the AFC and NFC.  (4 picks)</li>
                <li>Individual leaders in passing, rushing, receiving, sacks, and interceptions for both the
                    AFC and NFC. (10 picks)</li>
                <li>The team that will score the most points in each conference (AFC and NFC). (2 picks)</li>
                <li>Tiebreaker: Choose the team with the most special teams touchdowns.
                    (Kickoffs and punts returned for touchdowns). (1 pick)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Changing your picks</h3>
                <p>Unlike the MLBPool2, there is no opportunity to change your picks at
                    the season's halfway mark.</p>
            <h3>Individual Leaders</h3>
                <p> These are staggered to improve the odds of earning points.
                    Using most passing yards thrown by a QB, if the player you pick ends up throwing for the most
                    yards, you get 30 points.  If he is second in passing yards, you get 20 points.
                    If he is third, you get 10 points.  You will choose an individual leader in each category for
                    both conferences (AFC and NFC).</p>
            <h3>Double Points Bonus</h3>
                <p> If you are unique in your choice of any pick, you will be eligible for
                    double points in that category.  For instance, if you are the only person to pick Russell Wilson
                    for passing yards, and he somehow ends up in the mix, you would earn 60 points instead of 30
                    (if he ends in 1st place), 40 instead of 20 (2nd place), or 20 instead of 10
                    <b>if no one else has chosen him</b>.  This applies to all individual picks and you can
                    earn points (and double points if you are the only one to pick that player) if the player
                    you choose finishes in first, second or third.  If you are the only player to pick
                    the Cleveland Browns to finish first in the AFC North, you would earn 100 points, instead of 50.
                    NFLPool is typically won by players who guess correctly on the double points bonus.  There
                    are 1600 total possible points to be earned, excluding the double points for unqiue picks.</p>

            <h2>Points Breakdown:</h2>

            <h3>Division picks</h3>
                <p>For each division in the two conferences, pick which teams will come in
                first, second and last place.  If you pick the New England Patriots to come in first,
                    and they finish first, you earn 50 points. You <strong>can</strong> pick
                    the same team multiple times.  You could pick the Patriots to finish first
                    and second to hedge your bet.  8 divisions of three picks each:</p>
